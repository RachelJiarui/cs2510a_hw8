MERGING JAZMYN'S AND RACHEL'S SOKOBAN VERSIONS

COMPARISONS
Similarities:
- Had a SokobanWorld which distinguished two layers to a level which
  separated the board pieces on the floor versus the board pieces on top
- Had an interface for all the board pieces
- Checked if a player could move into a board piece or not (if something
  was blocking the player's way, like a wall)

Differences:
- Jazmyn's version checked that the two layers to a level had the same
  dimensions
- Rachel's version distinguished the two layers to a level within the
  interface for the board piece, where one board piece had a bottom and 
  top element while Jazmyn had two lists for the bottom and top
- Jazmyn utilized function objects over generic lists while Rachel used
  non-generic lists
- Jazmyn used Posn to check and find the positions of board pieces while
  Rachel did not

IMPLEMENTATION
Keepers:
- Keep interface and data design for board pieces
- Keep Jazmyn's use of Posn. This element will be extremely helpful as it 
  allows for quick identification of board pieces at a specific location
  which can help us with more complicated player movement involving the
  movement of blocks
- Keep Jazmyn's checks to verifying if a SokobanWorld is valid or not
- Keep Jazmyn and Rachel's idea of separating floor and on top of floor 
  board piece logic
- Keep player movement, onKeyEvent
- Keep Sokoban FunWorld

Discarded:
- Bye bye to generic lists and function objects
- Since we're using Jazmyn's implementation of board pieces, throw out
  Rachel's version of board piece where each board piece has a top
  and bottom piece

FUTURE PLANS
The biggest change lies in the implementation of ArrayLists. This means:
- Removing all generic lists and replacing them with ArrayLists
- Creating an ArrayUtils class to do all the functions that used to be
  implemented in ConsList and MtList
