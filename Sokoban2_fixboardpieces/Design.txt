DESCRIPTION

IBoardPiece - this is an interface for IBoardPiece. All of the board pieces in the level
implement it to make sure they each implement necessary methods that can be called on
a physical element in the game. They serve as the most basic units of our level

	Data that implements IBoardPiece

	Trophy - The Trophy is the board piece that can be
	moved around by the player witht he goal of matching one up to each target of
	the same color, allowing the player to win

	Player - The Player is the object that the person playing this Sokoban level
	physically controls. The actual player can directly move the Player piece
	given proper conditions

	Wall - The Wall is a board piece which the player cannot walk through

	Target - The Target is the board piece that the player must move the Trophies
	onto in order to win the game, making it the primary goal

	Box - The Box is a board piece which serves as an obstacle to the player
	similarly to the wall, although it can be moved (though not in this implementation)

	BlankSpace - The BlankSpace is a board piece which the player can move onto and
	replace, whereas other board pieces represent physical objects

Level - this class represents our level. Creating a level class allows us to create methods
that better show the relationship between these two sets of board pieces, as well as makes
creating the logic of our level easier by allowing methods to be created regarding the interaction
of different board pieces
    Within our level, we have two ArrayLists of a row (ArrayList) of board pieces to represent
    the map. One layer being the floor, which includes data such as a Target and BlankSpace
    while the other layer being the content on top of the floor, which includes data such as
    Player, Wall, Box, Trophy and Hole.

Utils - this class' purpose is to house methods that required arguments but didn't need
to be called on specific objects.

ArrayUtils - this class' purpose is to house methods that modifies or uses ArrayLists as
arguments.

SokobanWorld - this class extends World, allowing us to run the actual level and enable
player inputs. Being a game, this is integral, as we wouldn't be ablr to implement methods
that allow the player to move without it. It uses a level as an input, but since it extends
World, it can update the level as time goes on.

ExamplesLevel - this class allows us to test methods that we created in our various classes
to make sure they work.

ExamplesSokobanWorld - this class allows us to store some examples of levels to be played
in SokobanWorld. It also is where we can call out bigBang method to make the game run.
